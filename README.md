# ReactRoles

Easily setup Discord reaction roles with this easy to use bot.

## Running Locally

Ensure you have both [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) installed

A `config.ts` file in the `src` directory is **required**.

Take a look at [`src/config.template.ts`](src/config.template.ts) for the variables you need to supply.

Once you have your config ready, open a terminal and run `npm install && npm start`
